# Dissertation

The deposited version of my dissertation in Spanish Linguistics. Please cite as:

Eager, Christopher D. (2017). *Contrast preservation and constraints on individual phonetic variation*. Doctoral thesis. Univserity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.


## Data

The two datasets analyzed in the dissertation can be found in the 'data' folder.  The 'ptkbdg.rds' dataset is the same as the **plosives** dataset in the *nauf* package.  If you re-analyze either of these datasets in a publication, please cite the dissertation (see above).


## Replicating the analysis with the *standardize* and *nauf* packages

The methodology employed in the dissertation can be replicated using the *standardize* and *nauf* packages.  The *nauf* package does not currently support Bayesian regressions; and even when it does, it will do so through interfacing with the *rstanarm* package, and so exactly replicating the dissertation will require a bit of work.  I will add an R-markdown file showing how to use the Bayesian models in the 'Stan' folder to replicate the analysis.


## Typos

See 'typos.md' for a current list of known typos and errors in the dissertation.
